# BabyFormula

## Rohit Tasks
- 

## Rohan Tasks
- Biden now has this operation 'fly formula'? Can we track reactions to this? 
- Retweets of political figures/political messaging (I'll ask Joyojeet)
- connections to the roeVwade conversations that are ongoing

## Soham Tasks
- Political Leaning of each tweet (Republican V Democrat)
- State-wise distribution of Tweets
- Research literature to infer location from tweet

## Unassigned Tasks (up for grabs)
- Tweets from politicians (compare traction received on tweets on Formula vs overall tweets)
- Wordcloud (hashtag cloud) per state
- Fake News (Formula sent to Mexico claims) in Biden's tweets
- Topics in response to Biden's tweet on Op Fly Formula

## Wish List
- Add tweets to database (??)
- Location Inference (dialect, BFS through friend circle until someone slips up, unsupervised learning)
- Clustering reactions with word2vec etc
- How is the impact of the shortage spread across racial/economic groups?
- Could we say something about this based on the zipcodes of tweets? (waiting for location inference
- What kind of misinformation is being spread about this, where, and by whom? (e.g. that formula is being sent to the mexico border)
- Independent question about testing protocols --- what fraction of testing would be appropriate in factories/what are the tradeoffs here? 
- Separate resource allocation question: what is an equitable way to distribute the formula?
